# Omegle_MERN

## Introduction

This readme provides an overview of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project and its components.

## Project Overview

The MERN stack project is a full-stack web development project that leverages the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing data.
- **Express.js**: A backend framework for building web applications and APIs using Node.js.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure typically includes the following components:

- **Client**: Contains the front-end code written in React.js.
- **Server**: Contains the back-end code written in Node.js using Express.js.
- **Database**: Contains MongoDB database configurations and models.
